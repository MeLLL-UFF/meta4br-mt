frase
chip off the old block
face like thunder
ants in your pants
chew the fat
as high as a kite
behind the eight ball
backseat driver
dropping the ball
have a lot on your plate
chip on your shoulder
flying off the handle
caught red-handed
close shave
dressed to kill
burn a hole in your pocket
by the skin of your teeth
beef up
a snowball's chance in hell
bring home the bacon
can't cut the mustard
all thumbs
blue in the face
cat's meow
bite the dust
bite the bullet
butter wouldn't melt
eat your heart out
cutting corners
dead in the water
back on your feet
ace in the hole
bring to the table
bend over backward
burst at the seams
batten down the hatches
bolt from the blue
big time
crash and burn
beat a hasty retreat
hard as nails
down in the dumps
frog in your throat
keep your chin up
blood is thicker than water
get the ball rolling
hit the sack
coming up roses
fall through the cracks
left out in the cold
call the shots
as fit as a fiddle
couch potato
another string to your bow
grasp at straws
give someone the cold shoulder
by the book
don't count your chickens before they hatch
bitten by the bug
blue collar
cut from the same cloth
call it a day
against the grain
make waves
blaze a trail
apple of my eye
bad apple
bad egg
carry a torch
burst your bubble
cooking up a storm
hit the ground running
by a hair's breadth
as gentle as a lamb
blown away
add insult to injury
be on cloud nine
"easy come, easy go"
cat nap
alive and kicking
bend the rules
come down to earth
come up against a brick wall
by a long shot
at the helm
all bark and no bite
big picture
break a leg
bridge the gap
bare your soul
red herring
crying over spilled milk
let the cat out of the bag
icing on the cake
have the upper hand
adding insult to injury
hit the books
how the cookie crumbles
chained to the desk
carry the torch
clear the air
bare bones
They are driving to the countryside.
falling apart at the seams
coming full circle
a piece of cake
broken dreams
at your wit’s end
dive in headfirst
burnt to a crisp
big shoes to fill
feeling under the weather
let sleeping dogs lie
better safe than sorry
all in a day's work
airing dirty laundry
burn the midnight oil
fighting a losing battle
dying to know
She is ironing her clothes.
bigger fish to fry
cost an arm and a leg
face the music
back to the grind
a clean slate
full plate
blind leading the blind
bird's eye view
as good as gold
as plain as day
as smooth as silk
make a mountain out of a molehill
darkest before dawn
a far cry
black mark
dropping like flies
like riding a bike
She is painting a picture on the canvas.
